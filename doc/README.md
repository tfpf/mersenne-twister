* All members of `struct mt19937_32_t` (32-bit MT19937) and `struct mt19937_64_t` (64-bit MT19937) objects should be
  considered private.
* The entities documented below are macros, but written to behave like functions. Hence, I document them as if they are
  functions.
* The last argument of each of the macros is `mt`, which denotes the 32- or 64-bit MT19937 object to use.
  * **This is an optional argument.** If it is not provided, the internal 32- or 64-bit MT19937 object is used.
  * For instance, `mt19937_rand32();` and `mt19937_rand32(foo);` are both valid invocations of `mt19937_rand32`—the
    former generates a pseudorandom number using the internal 32-bit MT19937 object, and the latter does so using
    `foo`.
  * The internal 32- and 64-bit MT19937 objects are initialised by default as if they were seeded with 5489. As a
    result, the sequences of numbers generated by them (when not seeded manually) are identical to those generated by
    default-constructed `std::mt19937` and `std::mt19937_64` objects of the C++ standard library.
* Further arguments beyond `mt`, if given, are ignored without warnings.
* Whenever a function has a Python API, it does not take the `mt` argument. In other words, all Python functions use
  the internal MT19937 objects. The CPython implementation has a global interpreter lock, and (looking at the Python
  bytecode disassembly) a C function call corresponds to a single Python bytecode instruction. Hence, there are no race
  conditions to worry about, and the provided functions are thread-safe.
  * The Python API functions are given names similar to those below. Nevertheless, you can view *their* documentation
    by entering `import mt19937` and then `help(mt19937)` at the Python REPL.
